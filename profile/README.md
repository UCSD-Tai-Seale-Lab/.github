# About us
We seek to **discover** new ways to improve health, to **disseminate and implement** discoveries into evidence-based practices, and to **enhance** joy in the practice of medicine.

We are a multidisciplinary team of researchers, focused on the **science of healthcare delivery**.

Combining user-centered design methods, hypothesis-driven and data-driven research methods, we rigorously test theories, models, and methods to determine the impact of innovations on health **outcomes**, human (patient and healthcare professionals) **experience**, and **affordability** of healthcare.
